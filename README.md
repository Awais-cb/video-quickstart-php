# Twilio Video SDK Quick Start for PHP

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own video apps with Twilio Video. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the config values we need to run the application:

* Account SID: Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/console).
* API Key: Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/dev-tools/api-keys).
* API Secret: Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/video/dev-tools/api-keys).
